# The Tower of Illusions and Deceit
The Tower of Illusions and Deceit is a short text-based terminal game. I made this as a project for Codecademy's Computer Science's Introduction to Programming. 

## Prerequisite
You need to have python installed to be able to play the game.

## How to play
To run the game, download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository. Then open your terminal in the file's location and open `ToIaD_game.py` with python.Â 

Input "1" or "2" to the terminal when prompted to choose your desired action.

## More info
There are 4 main endings plus a secret ending. Try to get them all!
