I know that you must be in a hurry, but before you go, at least have a toast with me!\" The host pushes a cup filled to the brim with what looks to be wine and scrutinizes you with his beady eyes.

How do you find my wine?\" You praise his drink to the heavens, then bid him farewell and proceed to the staircase behind him.\n\nYou've reached the top of the tower. Or is it the bottom? You're not sure anymore. Looking through the stained glass depicting fantastical creatures, you see the forest far below you.
